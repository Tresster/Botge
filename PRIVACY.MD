# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

The only data we collect is `guild`, `channelId`, `user` and the guild's emojis which are necessary for the bot's functionality. `guild` is solely used for recognizing if the bot is in a server, collecting the server's emojis and storing the guild's ID. `channelId` is solely used for recognizing if the channel is a text channel and for the ability to send messages to that channel. Please note that these are not considered personal user data, except `user`, which is solely used for recognizing if the user is a bot and storing the user's ID for a limited time, otherwise it is not processed.

## Data Storage

The only data we store are `guildId`, `channelId` and `userId`, from which `channelId` and `userId` are only stored for the duration necessary for the `pingme` command to function correctly. No other data is collected or stored. All interactions with the bot, aside from `guildIds`, are transient and are not logged or saved.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any personal data with third parties. The mentioned are used solely for the bot's functionality and are not shared with any third parties.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review our Privacy Policy periodically.
