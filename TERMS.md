# Terms of Service

By using **Botge** (“the Bot,” “the Software,” or “the Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”) and [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Tresster/Botge/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).  
If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Service.

## Compliance with Discord Policies

Botge operates on the Discord platform. All users must follow Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).  
Any activity that violates Discord’s rules will also be considered a violation of these Terms.

## User Content

You are responsible for any content, data, or media you upload or share using Botge (“User Content”).  
The operators of Botge are not responsible for material shared by users through Discord or the Service.

## Prohibited Content

Users may not submit or distribute content that contains or promotes:

- Sexually explicit or pornographic material
- Gore, excessive violence, or harm to animals
- Hate speech, harassment, or material intended to offend or shock others
- Content that is illegal or violates Discord’s Terms or applicable laws

Violation of this section may result in suspension or termination of access to the Service.

## Media Handling and Consent

By submitting media or other content to Botge, you grant the operators permission to **temporarily store, process, and transform** that content as needed to operate the Service.  
This processing is conducted in accordance with our Privacy Policy.  
Media may be reviewed, automatically or manually, to ensure compliance with these Terms.

## Service Availability and Modifications

Botge is provided on an **“as is” and “as available”** basis, without any warranty of any kind.  
While we strive to maintain reliability, we do not guarantee uninterrupted service or error-free performance.  
We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time without prior notice.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the operators of Botge, their affiliates, and contributors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of data or profits, arising from your use or inability to use the Service.  
Your only remedy for dissatisfaction with the Service is to stop using it.

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to abuse, exploit, spam, reverse-engineer, or otherwise interfere with the normal operation of the Service.  
You also agree not to use Botge for any illegal purposes or to violate Discord’s policies.

## Right to Refuse Service

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to **limit, suspend, or terminate** access to the Service for any user or Discord server that violates these Terms, Discord’s rules, or applicable laws, or for any other reason deemed appropriate.

## Updates to These Terms

We may revise or update these Terms from time to time.  
The most current version will always be available on the official Botge documentation or repository.
By continuing to use the Service after updates are posted, you agree to the revised Terms.

## Severability

If any part of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws applicable in both the location of the operators of Botge and the location of the user.  
In the event of any conflict between those laws, the laws applicable in the location where the operators of Botge are based shall take precedence.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact the operators of the Service through the [Botge Discord](https://discord.gg/tMZ79dym) server.
