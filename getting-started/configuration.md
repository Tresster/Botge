# Configuration

Botge needs extra configuration to customize it to a streamer's emotes and clips.\
While technically it is not required to configure Botge, you won't be able to use `/clip` and won't have personal emotes in commands.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need owner or administrator permissions to configure Botge!
{% endhint %}

## Configuration

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Use `/settings` command
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click on the _Configuration_ button&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Input the streamer's Twitch username and their 7TV emote set link
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
BTTV and FFZ emote sets will be acquired automatically based on Twitch username, if they exist.
{% endhint %}

## Other settings

Botge can be further customized.\
You can set roles which can use the `/settings` command, which roles can add emotes, permit everyone to add emote and you can open the added emote deletion menu from `/settings` .
